## TLDR
AiPPAREL will let the user either upload or select two images, one as the main image and the other as a style source. The program will then use style tranfer to create a new image, recreating the main image in the style of the other.

## Idea
There are plenty of style transfer websites in the world, and lots of printing websites, however there aren't ANY style transfer websites that let you choose both the target and the style images and print the result. AiPPAREL does it all, we wanted to create this project to implement AI (style transfer) and our team has a background on web-dev, so the clear solution is to create this unique and awesome website.

## Procedure
The initial style transfer implementation was one of the first things implmented, we spent a lot of time debating the best way we could create a fully functional web-page with our knowledge and skill sets. We spent most of day 1 of hackumass simply figuring out what we really wanted and how to get it. By the end of that night, we had a landing-page and found some API's that were absolute game changers. After we knew what we wanted it was just a matter of time to put everything together

## API's
* printful.com/api 
* * this is a beautiful printing website that decided to share their wealth, we initially had no idea how to get decent looking preview images, or how to do printing that wasn't just squares in the middle of a shirt. Printful has it all! They offer their api for free, and then run a business off of other companies designing t-shirts

# AiPPAREL Created @ HackUMass
We are AiPPAREL, a startup that sells clothing and accessories designed with artificial intelligence. We use neural style transfer to allow users to create unique and beautiful shirts, hoodies, phone cases, and more. Users can then buy their creations through our shopping portal.




# What's Next
We will be turning this into a fully functioning business after the hackathon and customers will be able to purchase products once we go live. Our next steps are to:
1. Enable the processing of transactions and payments
2. Optimize the data pipelines and clean up the code base
3. Upgrade our servers to function at scale
4. Establish a legal entity and develop marketing campaigns
